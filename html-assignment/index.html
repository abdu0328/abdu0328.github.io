    <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
    <p> For the past few years I've been thoughtfully exploring a career that inspires me. Most recently, I have learned the ins and outs of <abbr title="User Experience and User Interface"> UX/UI</abbr> design and developer, and want to apply this to develop digital products and systems. I have since then constantly challenged myself to grow in this space and loved every moment. </p>

    <p>I like to keep active in some shape or form. I either workout, go bouldering, or just recently, I started to play volleyball. I love photography, especially moreso recently with my film camera. I’m also a fairly big geek where I love to play video or board games with my friends.</p>
